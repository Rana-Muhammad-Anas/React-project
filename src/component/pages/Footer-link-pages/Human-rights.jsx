      <h1> Human Rights Policy </h1>
      <p>
        NETSOL’s Human Rights policy applies to every NETSOL employee and is
        based on the following key principles: Conducting all of our business
        lawfully in all the communities that we serve and in a manner that
        respects and promotes human rights and equality for all employees,
        agency staff and suppliers wherever they are based. A recognition and
        respect of the fundamental human right to allow employees/people to lead
        a dignified and independent life, free from abuse, violations and any
        form of discrimination. A recognition that peoples’ human rights can be
        directly and indirectly affected by the company’s operations, products
        and services, and to take steps to identify and reduce the company’s
        negative impact on communities and environments wherever possible. A
        desire to act as a responsible organization in achieving a common set of
        standards applying to all peoples and all nations in the commitment to
        continual social and economic improvement. Oppose and prohibit the use
        of human trafficking, child labor, slavery and slave labor, and expect
        the same from all of our business partners and suppliers. As a global
        business, the Company is committed to compliance with the International
        Bill of Human Rights and both applicable labor laws and specific human
        rights laws such as the U.K.’s Modern Slavery Act. A commitment to seek
        to only enter into contractual relations with third parties who
        demonstrate a desire to apply similar principles to the above through
        their own frameworks and initiatives.
      </p>
      <h3>Supply Chain</h3>
      <p>
        NETSOL recognizes that the successful implementation of our Human Rights
        Policy is heavily influenced by the cooperation and support of our
        supply chains. If suppliers or contractors act in a way that is
        inconsistent with our Human Rights Policy and/or are complicit in any
        human rights abuses, NETSOL will look to terminate their contracts and
        end all commercial relations with them.
