      <h2>Our Organization:</h2>
      <p>
        NetSol Technologies, Inc. (“NETSOL”) acknowledges internationally
        proclaimed human rights and is fully committed to combat slavery and
        human trafficking. We design, develop, market, and export proprietary

        subsidiaries worldwide including the United Kingdom and our parent

        permanent employees worldwide. The NetSol Human Rights Policy recognizes
        international human rights as set out in the Bill of Human Rights. Our
        Policy reflects our responsibilities around slavery and human
        trafficking.

      <h1>Our Policies and Due Diligence on Slavery and Human Trafficking:</h1>
      <p>
        We are committed to ensuring that there is no modern slavery or human
        trafficking in our supply chains or in any part of our business. As a
        software and services company, we do not have a manufacturing base or
        supply chain for tangible goods. Accordingly, we believe there is a very
        low likelihood of slavery and/or human trafficking in our supply chain.
        However, our company is committed to promoting and protecting human
        rights wherever we do business. We expect our suppliers and other
        business partners to be committed to ethical behavior, to comply with
        all applicable laws and regulations, and to take action to promote the
        eradication of human trafficking and slavery. We will continue to work
        with our suppliers and refine our own requirements and processes to
        reinforce our commitment to human rights and a culture of ethical
        behavior, integrity and respect. This statement is made pursuant to
        section 54(1) of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 and constitutes our
        Company’s slavery and human trafficking statement for the financial year
        ending June 30, 2024.
